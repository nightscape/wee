    # Take snapshots of objects that should correctly be backtracked.
    #
    # Backtracking means that you can go back in time of the components' state.
    # Therefore it is neccessary to take snapshots of those objects that want to
    # participate in backtracking. Taking snapshots of the whole component tree
    # would be too expensive and unflexible. Note that methods
    # <i>take_snapshot</i> and <i>restore_snapshot</i> are called for those
    # objects to take the snapshot (they behave like <i>marshal_dump</i> and
    # <i>marshal_load</i>). Overwrite them if you want to define special
    # behaviour. 
    #
    # For example if you dynamically add children to your component, you might
    # want to backtrack the children array: 
    #
    #   def backtrack(state)
    #     super
    #     backtrack_children(state)
    #   end
    #
    # By default only the decoration chain is backtracked. This is
    # required to correctly backtrack called components. To disable
    # backtracking of the decorations, change method
    # Component#backtrack_decoration to a no-operation:
    #
    #   def backtrack_decoration(state)
    #     # nothing here
    #   end
    #
    # [+state+]
    #    An object of class State
    #
    def backtrack(state)
      backtrack_decoration(state)
      each_child do |child|
        child.decoration.backtrack(state)
      end
    end

    def children
      @children || []
    end
    def <<(child)
      add_child(child)
    end

    protected

    def backtrack_decoration(state)
      state.add_ivar(self, :@decoration, @decoration)
    end

    def backtrack_children(state)
      state.add_ivar(self, :@children, (@children and @children.dup))
    end

    #
    # Iterates over all direct child components. 
    #
    def each_child(&block)
      @children.each(&block) if @children
    end

    #
    # Add a child to the component. Example:
    # 
    #   class YourComponent < Wee::Component
    #     def initialize
    #       super()
    #       add_child ChildComponent.new
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If you dynamically add child components to a component at run-time (not in
    # initialize), then you should consider to backtrack the children array (of
    # course only if you want backtracking at all): 
    #   
    #   def backtrack(state)
    #     super
    #     state.add(self.children)
    #   end
    #
