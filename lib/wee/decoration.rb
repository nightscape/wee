  # #process_callbacks, #render_on and #backtrack to the next decoration in
  # the chain. Subclasses should provide special behaviour in these methods,
  # otherwise the decoration does not make sense.
  #
  # For example, a HeaderFooterDecoration class could draw a header and footer
  # around the decorations or components below itself:
  #
  #   class HeaderFooterDecoration < Wee::Decoration
  #     alias render_on render_presenter_on
  #     def render(r)
  #       r.text "header"

  #       r.text "footer"
  #     end

    # all decorations or components "below" it (everything that follows this
    # decoration in the chain). In other words, it's the owner of everything
    # "below" itself.

    # decoration is added in front of all other local decorations but after all
