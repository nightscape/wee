  # A Wee::AnswerDecoration is wrapped around a component that will call
  # Component#answer. This makes it possible to use such components without the
  # need to call them (Component#call), e.g. as child components of other
  # components.

  class AnswerDecoration < Decoration

    #
    # Used to unwind the component call chain in Component#answer.

    # will be executed, where +answer+ is of class Answer which includes the
    # arguments passed to Component#answer.

  module CallAnswerMixin

    protected

    #
    # Call another component. The calling component is neither rendered nor are
    # it's callbacks processed until the called component answers using method
    # #answer. 
    #
    # [+component+]
    #   The component to be called.
    #
    # [+return_callback+]
    #   Is invoked when the called component answers.
    #
    # <b>How it works</b>
    # 
    # The component to be called is wrapped with an AnswerDecoration and a
    # Delegate decoration. The latter is used to redirect to the called
    # component. Once the decorations are installed, we end the processing of
    # callbacks prematurely.
    #
    # When at a later point in time the called component invokes #answer, this
    # will raise a AnswerDecoration::Answer exception which is catched by the
    # AnswerDecoration we installed before calling this component, and as such,
    # whose process_callbacks method was called before we gained control.
    #
    # The AnswerDecoration then invokes the <tt>answer_callback</tt> to cleanup
    # the decorations we added during #call and finally passes control to the
    # <tt>return_callback</tt>.
    #
    def call(component, &return_callback)
      delegate = Wee::Delegate.new(component)
      answer = Wee::AnswerDecoration.new do |answ|
        remove_decoration(delegate)
        component.remove_decoration(answer)
        return_callback.call(*answ.args) if return_callback
      end
      add_decoration(delegate)
      component.add_decoration(answer)
      session.send_response(nil)
    end

    #
    # Similar to method #call, but using continuations.

      delegate = Wee::Delegate.new(component)
